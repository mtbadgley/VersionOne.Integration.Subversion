It is not recommended that poll intervals remain this low in a production instance. \n * Update: Source code project was dependent on .NET 3.5. Now source code project depends on the latest .NET SDK. \n * Updated: Integration depends on Log4Net \n * Updated: Poll time interval defaults to 30 minutes \n * Fixed: Configuration Utility allows editing of the VersionOne credential fields when Windows Integrated Authentication is enabled. This enables configuring the integrations to connect to VersionOne as a user other than the local service account when the VersionOne instance is configured for Windows integrated authentication.",
